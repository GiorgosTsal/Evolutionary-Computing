    """ Particle swarm minimization algorithm with dynamic random neighborhood topology.
        
        pso = DynNeighborPSO(ObjectiveFcn, nVars, ...) creates the DynNeighborPSO object stored in variable pso and 
            performs all swarm initialization tasks (including calling the output function once, if provided).
        
        pso.optimize() subsequently runs the whole iterative process.
        
        After initialization, the pso object has the following properties that can be queried (also during the 
            iterative process through the output function):
            o All the arguments passed during boject (e.g., pso.MaxIterations, pso.ObjectiveFcn,  pso.LowerBounds, 
                etc.). See the documentation of the __init__ member below for supported options and their defaults.
            o Iteration: the current iteration. Its value is -1 after initialization 0 or greater during the iterative
                process.
            o Swarm: the current iteration swarm (nParticles x nVars)
            o Velocity: the current velocity vectors (nParticles x nVars)
            o CurrentSwarmFitness: the current swarm's fitnesses for all particles (nParticles x 1)
            o PreviousBestPosition: the best-so-far positions found for each individual (nParticles x nVars)
            o PreviousBestFitness: the fitnesses of the best-so-far individuals (nParticles x 1)
            o GlobalBestFitness: the overall best fitness attained found from the beginning of the iterative process
            o GlobalBestPosition: the overall best position found from the beginning of the iterative process
            o AdaptiveNeighborhoodSize: the current neighborhood size
            o MinNeighborhoodSize: the minimum neighborhood size allowed
            o AdaptiveInertia: the current value of the inertia weight
            o StallCounter: the stall counter value (for updating inertia)
            o StopReason: string with the stopping reason (only available at the end, when the algorithm stops)
            o GlobalBestSoFarFitnesses: a numpy vector that stores the global best-so-far fitness in each iteration. 
                Its size is MaxIterations+1, with the first element (GlobalBestSoFarFitnesses[0]) reserved for the best
                fitness value of the initial swarm. Accordingly, pso.GlobalBestSoFarFitnesses[pso.Iteration+1] stores 
                the global best fitness at iteration pso.Iteration. Since the global best-so-far is updated only if 
                lower that the previously stored, this is a non-strictly decreasing function. It is initialized with 
                NaN values and therefore is useful for plotting it, as the ydata of the matplotlib line object (NaN 
                values are just not plotted). In the latter case, the xdata would have to be set to 
                np.arange(pso.MaxIterations+1)-1, so that the X axis starts from -1.

                o nVars: the number of problem variables
            The algorithm tries to minimize the ObjectiveFcn.
            
            The arguments LowerBounds & UpperBounds lets you define the lower and upper bounds for each variable. They 
            must be either scalars or vectors/lists with nVars elements. If not provided, LowerBound is set to -1000 
            and UpperBound is set to 1000 for all variables. If vectors are provided and some of its elements are not 
            finite (NaN or +-Inf), those elements are also replaced with +-1000 respectively.
            
            The rest of the arguments are the algorithm's options:
                o SwarmSize (default:  min(100,10*nVars)): Number of particles in the swarm, an integer greater than 1.
                o SelfAdjustmentWeight (default: 1.49): Weighting (finite scalar) of each particle’s best position when
                    adjusting velocity.
                o SocialAdjustmentWeight (default: 1.49): Weighting (finite scalar) of the neighborhood’s best position 
                    when adjusting velocity.
                o InertiaRange (default: [0.1, 1.1]): Two-element real vector with same sign values in increasing 
                    order. Gives the lower and upper bound of the adaptive inertia. To obtain a constant (nonadaptive) 
                    inertia, set both elements of InertiaRange to the same value.
                o MinNeighborsFraction (default: 0.25): Minimum adaptive neighborhood size, a scalar in [0, 1].
                o FunctionTolerance (default: 1e-6): Iterations end when the relative change in best objective function 
                    value over the last MaxStallIterations iterations is less than options.FunctionTolerance.
                o MaxIterations (default: 200*nVars): Maximum number of iterations.
                o MaxStallIterations (default: 20): Iterations end when the relative change in best objective function 
                    value over the last MaxStallIterations iterations is less than options.FunctionTolerance.
                o OutputFcn (default: None): Output function, which is called at the end of each iteration with the 
                    iterative data and they can stop the solver. The output function must have the signature 
                    stop = fun(pso), returning True if the iterative process must be terminated. pso is the 
                    DynNeighborPSO object (self here). The output function is also called after swarm initialization 
                    (i.e., within this member function).
                o UseParallel (default: False): Compute objective function in parallel when True. The latter requires
                    package joblib to be installed (i.e., pip install joplib or conda install joblib).
